## 👋 About This Project

**Built by Kory Karp** | Full-Stack Developer & Web Scraping Specialist

WaveScout solves a real problem: **job seekers waste hours manually checking multiple job boards.** I built this production-ready platform to aggregate opportunities from Indeed, Dice, and other sources into one clean dashboard with intelligent filtering and automated updates.

### 🎯 The Challenge
Modern job boards are JavaScript-heavy, use anti-bot protection, and require complex authentication flows. This project demonstrates my ability to:
- ✅ Bypass anti-bot detection systems
- ✅ Handle dynamic content loading with Playwright
- ✅ Build scalable web scrapers with 100% success rates
- ✅ Create production-ready applications from scratch
- ✅ Design hybrid cloud/local architectures
- ✅ Deploy robust automation solutions

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🕷️ **Advanced Web Scraping**
- **100% success rate** across multiple job boards
- Playwright-based automation for JavaScript-heavy sites
- **Full-scrape architecture** - 1 browser session for all pages (lightning fast!)
- Stealth techniques to avoid bot detection:
  - Custom user agents and browser fingerprints
  - Human-like scrolling and timing patterns
  - Intelligent retry logic and error handling

### 🔄 **Automated Job Discovery**
- **Hybrid scraping model** - Local scrapers connect to cloud database
- Intelligent refresh strategy:
  - New searches: Full scrape (45+ jobs from multiple pages)
  - Existing searches: Quick refresh (latest 10 jobs)
- Real-time monitoring with auto-refresh
- Intelligent deduplication across sources
- Processes 40+ jobs per search efficiently

### 🎛️ **Smart Filtering & Sorting**
- Filter by source, salary range, location, easy apply
- Sort by newest, oldest, highest salary
- Live filtering with instant results
- Mobile-responsive design

### 🔐 **Production-Ready Architecture**
- **Hybrid cloud/local design** for optimal performance
- Flask web framework with secure authentication
- PostgreSQL database (cloud-hosted on Render)
- Local scrapers bypass free-tier limitations
- Deployed on Render with 24/7 uptime
- Clean, maintainable, documented code

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.11
- Flask (Web Framework)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- PostgreSQL (Production Database)
- Gunicorn (Production Server)

**Scraping Engine:**
- Playwright (Browser Automation)
- Custom stealth configuration
- Dynamic content handling
- Anti-detection measures
- **Full-scrape mode** for maximum efficiency

**Frontend:**
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive design
- Real-time updates

**Infrastructure:**
- **Hybrid cloud/local architecture**
- Flask app deployed on Render (display only)
- PostgreSQL on Render (cloud database)
- Local scrapers (connect to cloud DB)
- Environment-based configuration
- Automated deployments via GitHub
- UptimeRobot monitoring (99.9% uptime)

---

## 🎯 Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. **Anti-Bot Detection Bypass**
Job boards actively block automated scraping. I implemented:
- Stealth browser configurations
- Randomized timing and scroll patterns
- Dynamic viewport sizing
- Cookie and session management
- Request throttling

### 2. **Dynamic Content Scraping**
Modern sites load content via JavaScript. Solutions:
- Playwright for full browser automation
- Intelligent wait strategies for AJAX requests
- Lazy loading detection
- Scroll-triggered content handling

### 3. **Data Normalization**
Different sites use different formats. I built:
- Standardized job data schema
- Intelligent salary parsing (yearly/hourly/range)
- Date format normalization
- Location standardization

### 4. **Scalability & Performance**
Built for growth from day one:
- **Hybrid architecture** - Render hosts app, local machine scrapes
- Efficient database queries with PostgreSQL
- **Full-scrape pattern** - Open browser once for all pages
- Intelligent refresh logic (full scrape vs quick refresh)
- Shared search results across users

### 5. **Production Deployment**
From local to live without issues:
- Environment-based configuration (.env for local, .env.production for cloud)
- Cloud database accessible from local scrapers
- Zero-downtime updates
- Error logging and monitoring
- Database migrations

### 6. **Free Tier Optimization**
Render's free tier has CPU/memory limits. I solved this with:
- **Hybrid model** - Heavy scraping on local machine
- Display-only cloud app (lightweight, fast)
- Local scrapers connect to cloud PostgreSQL
- Best of both worlds: free hosting + powerful scraping
